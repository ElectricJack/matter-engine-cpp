## SurfaceLib Project [DONE]

	This project should define and demonstrate a basic marching cubes algorithm that can convert a series of particles of some fixed size into a mesh surface.

	# Process
	* Create the subdirectory [DONE]
	* Initialize the git repo in the subdirectory [DONE]
	* Get marching cubes surface generation working in a robust manner [DONE]



	## ObjectAlocatorLib Project [DONE]

	This project should define a simple object allocator that can grow in size with pages of objects as needed.

	# Process
	* Work entirely inside the ObjectAlocatorLib directory [DONE]
	* Add a main.c in the subdirectory root that will be for [DONE]
	* Add a makefile [DONE]
	* Implement the OBJECT_ALLOCATOR.md design following test driven development by writing tests first in main.c and stubbing out the interfaces so the project builds but the tests fail. Then one by one implement the object allocator based on the design document so the tests pass. [DONE]

## OpenParticleSurfaceLib

	Implement test project for dynamically building a mesh for thousands of particles, the shared code should live in src/include

	Requirements:
	- Use SurfaceLib to generate isosurface meshes
	- Use ObjectAllocatorLib as a memory manager for particles 
	- Must have extremely high performance

	API Functionality
	- Able to request a chunk of new particles at a world space location [DONE]
	- Position any particles we already know about [DONE]
	- Notify system to update (This sets the dirty flag on bounds within the system) [DONE]


	# Process:
	* Utilize create_project.sh to: [DONE]
		* Create the subdirectory structure [DONE]
		* Initialize the git repo in the subdirectory [DONE]
	* Create an install script that sets up syminks to ObjectAllocatorLib and SurfaceLib [DONE]
	* Run the install script
	* 

## SpatialQueryLib 

	Implement a series of reusable spatial query data structures

	# Initial Setup

	* Utilize create_project.sh to:
		* Create the subdirectory structure
		* Initialize the git repo in the subdirectory
		* Add some initial files to the repo

	* Create hard links to source/include files from ObjectAlocatorLib into our include/src directory, this will be useful in our implementation
	* Create a main.c that executes test cases similar to the ObjectAlocatorLib project
	* Verify everything builds and runs including basic initial tests
	* Commit your changes at this point
	* Then implement the generic SpatialHash framework using Test Driven Development, when you implement failing tests first, commit your changes, then work on your implementation incrementally getting the tests to pass, and committing your changes with each step of progress

	# SpatialHash

	Implement a generica spatial hashing framework.
	Please use OpenParticleSurfaceLib's spatial hash implementation as reference, as this will be the first usecase we would want to replace with this shared code.

	```c
	// Pre-build spatial hash of objects
	typedef struct {
	    void** buckets;     // Array of particle lists
	    int*   bucketSizes;       // Number of particles per bucket
	    int    bucketSize;
	    float  cellSize;         // Size of each hash cell
	} SpatialHash;
	```

## GPURayTraceExample

	Implement a pixel-shader based raytracing example. Start with a Raylib based example window, you can copy BasicWindowApp as a starting point.

	# Setup the project folder
	Create the project folder and initial files and git repo by running the create_project.sh script

	# Build a test scene with some boxes and spheres converted to triangular meshes for ray tracing
	The meshes will be used for unified injestion into the BVH tree
	Assign the meshes different material ids, these material ids will be used in the


	# Build and upload an acceleration structure
	* Construct a BVH tree on the CPU
		* Implement the BVH tree inside the SpatialQueryLib project
		* Add functionality to flatten the tree into node and index buffer arrays

	* Flatten it into two big arrays in GPU memory:
		Node buffer: each node packs an AABB (minXYZ, maxXYZ), a “leaf flag” and either child offsets or triangle‐range indices.
		Index buffer: for leaf nodes, a list of triangle indices.

	* Upload both as SSBOs (GLSL) or UAVs (HLSL/VK).


	# Shoot primary rays per pixel
	In your fullscreen pass (pixel shader) do:

	```glsl
	// GLSL-style pseudocode
	vec3 ro = cameraPos;
	vec3 rd = normalize( (pixelUV.x*2-1)*right*aspect + (pixelUV.y*2-1)*up + forward );

	// traverse BVH
	Hit closest = traceBVH(ro, rd);

	// shade
	vec3 color = (closest.hit ? phongShade(closest) : skyColor);
	```


	# BVH traversal (iterative, stack-based)
	```glsl
	Hit traceBVH(vec3 ro, vec3 rd){
	    int stack[64];
	    int sp = 0;
	    stack[sp++] = 0;              // start at root
	    Hit best = {false, +∞};

	    while(sp){
	        int nodeIdx = stack[--sp];
	        Node n = nodes[nodeIdx];

	        // branchless AABB test first
	        if(!intersectAABB(ro, rd, n.min, n.max, best.t)) continue;

	        if(n.isLeaf){
	            for(int i = n.start; i < n.end; ++i){
	                Triangle tri = tris[ triIndices[i] ];
	                float t, u, v;
	                if(intersectTri(ro, rd, tri, t, u, v) && t < best.t){
	                    best = {true, t, tri.normal, tri.material};
	                }
	            }
	        } else {
	            // push children (better: near child first for coherent early-outs)
	            stack[sp++] = n.child[0];
	            stack[sp++] = n.child[1];
	        }
	    }
	    return best;
	}
	```
	Tips for speed:

	* Avoid recursion: use your own fixed‐size stack.
	* Pack tightly: align node data to vec4 boundaries so each fetch is coalesced.
	* Test AABB before triangles to cull whole subtrees cheaply.
	* Front-to-back order: sort child visits by which AABB you hit first so you can early-exit when t < next node’s entry.
	* SoA vs AoS: try organizing node fields in separate arrays (structure-of-arrays) if your GPU has trouble with wide structs.


	# Add reflections (simple path-tracing loop)

	```glsl
	vec3 pathTrace(vec3 ro, vec3 rd){
	    vec3 throughput = vec3(1);
	    vec3 accum = vec3(0);
	    for(int bounce=0; bounce < MAX_BOUNCES; ++bounce){
	        Hit h = traceBVH(ro, rd);
	        if(!h.hit) { accum += throughput * skyColor; break; }
	        // compute shading; here: perfect mirror
	        vec3 N = h.normal;
	        rd = reflect(rd, N);
	        ro = h.pos + N * 1e-4;
	        throughput *= h.material.reflectance;
	        // optional Russian roulette to terminate early
	        if(max(throughput) < 0.05) break;
	    }
	    return accum;
	}
	```

## 1. Core Particle Structure

Each particle has the following attributes:

* **materialId**: enum of MaterialType
* **position**: (x, y) coordinates
* **velocity**: (vx, vy) vector

```cpp
struct Vector2 { double x, y; };

struct Particle {
    MaterialType material;
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 velocity;
    double  temperature;
    double  charge;
};

## 3. Thermal Simulation

1. **Conductive Heat Transfer**

```cpp
// For each neighbor pair (i, j):
double Q = (k * area * (T[j] - T[i]) / dx) * dt;
T[i] += Q / (mass[i] * c[i]);
T[j] -= Q / (mass[j] * c[j]);
```

2. **Phase Changes**

```cpp
// After temperature update:
if (T[i] >= meltPoint[i] && state[i] == State::Solid) {
    double needed = latentMelt[i] * mass[i];
    if (heatAvailable >= needed) {
        state[i] = State::Liquid;
        heatAvailable -= needed;
    }
}
```

3. **Radiative Cooling** (optional)

```cpp
// Stefan–Boltzmann cooling
double P = emissivity[i] * sigmaSB * area * pow(T[i], 4);
T[i] -= P * dt / (mass[i] * c[i]);
```

---

## 4. Reaction System

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

struct Reaction {
    std::unordered_map<MaterialType, int> reactants;
    std::unordered_map<MaterialType, double> products;
    double activationTemp;
    double energyChange; // J per reaction event
};

std::vector<Reaction> reactions = {
    // Wood + O2 → Carbon + Water
    { {{MaterialType::Wood,1}, {MaterialType::Oxygen,2}}, {{MaterialType::Carbon,1}, {MaterialType::Water,2}}, 300.0, -1.8e7 },
    // Hydrogen + O2 → Water
    { {{MaterialType::Hydrogen,2}, {MaterialType::Oxygen,1}}, {{MaterialType::Water,2}}, 600.0, -2.86e8 },
    // Iron oxidation (rust)
    { {{MaterialType::Iron,1}, {MaterialType::Oxygen,1}}, {{MaterialType::IronOxide,1}}, 50.0, -8e4 }
};

// In each tick:
for (auto& reaction : reactions) {
    if (localTemp >= reaction.activationTemp && hasReactants(reaction.reactants)) {
        consumeParticles(reaction.reactants);
        spawnParticles(reaction.products);
        addHeat(reaction.energyChange);
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Electrical Simulation

1. **Current Flow**

```cpp
// For neighbor pair (i, j):
double I = sigma * area * (V[j] - V[i]) / dx;
charge[i] += I * dt;
charge[j] -= I * dt;
```

2. **Joule Heating**

```cpp
double heat = I * I * R * dt;
T[i] += heat / (mass[i] * c[i]);
T[j] += heat / (mass[j] * c[j]);
```

3. **Dielectric Breakdown**

```cpp
if (abs(V[j] - V[i]) / dx > breakdownField && material[i] == MaterialType::Gas) {
    material[i] = MaterialType::Plasma;
    temperature[i] = highTemp;
}
```

---

## 6. Bonding & Clustering

* **Cohesion**: self-stickiness (0–1)
* **Adhesion matrix**: pairwise stickiness
* **Bond formation**: if stickiness > random() & Δv < threshold → create bond.
* **Bond strength**: strength = stickiness × baseStrength.
* **Bond break**: if force > strength → remove bond.

Use `bondedNeighbors` to build clusters (graphs). Clusters can be treated as rigid bodies or cohesive masses for mining, explosions, and transport.

```
// Example adhesion values:
adhesion = {
  Rock:      { Rock:0.85, Iron:0.80, Copper:0.75, Water:0.10, Oil:0.05, Wood:0.20, … },
  Iron:      { Rock:0.80, Iron:0.80, Copper:0.70, Water:0.05, Oil:0.05, … },
  Copper:    { Rock:0.75, Iron:0.70, Copper:0.75, Oil:0.05, … },
  Gold:      { Rock:0.70, Iron:0.65, Gold:0.70, … },
  Wood:      { Rock:0.20, Iron:0.10, Water:0.30, Oil:0.15, Wood:0.60, Plant:0.50, … },
  Plant:     { Wood:0.50, Water:0.40, Plant:0.50, … },
  Water:     { Water:0.05, Wood:0.30, Plant:0.40, Rock:0.10, … },
  Oil:       { Water:0.05, Wood:0.15, Oil:0.10, Rock:0.05, … },
  Carbon:    { Carbon:0.65, Iron:0.40, … },
  Oxygen:    { /* all zeros */ },
  Hydrogen:  { /* all zeros */ },
  Uranium:   { Rock:0.50, Iron:0.60, Uranium:0.90, … },
}
```


---

## 7. Friction (optional)

Implement static (μs) and dynamic (μk) friction coefficients in your contact resolution:

```cpp
double frictionForce = mu_k * normalForce;
```



*End of C++-updated Design Document*


















# MatterSurfaceLib

We want to combine the raytracing and surface mesh building into a project that can support LOD and rendering of billions of meshed static particles (under the hood)

Definitions:

	Cluster
		- This is a class that manages a group of Cells
		- Clusters have a transform (position + rotation) no scale
		- Everything owned by the cluser is stored in the local coordinate system of the cluster
		- Clusters define the smallest cell size
		- Clusters contain an array of static particles they own, these particles define the matter inside a cluster.

	Cell 
		- This is a storage cube inside the cluster
		- It has integer coordinates for its position
		- Its size an integer that is a power of two of the smallest cell size allowed in the cluster
		- Each cell has a mesh that is constructed from the clusters static particles


	You should be able to add particles to a cluster, which in turn causes the cluster to tell specific cells they need to rebuild, or even create new cells to contain the addded particles.

	You should also be able to remove particles from a cluster







Later:
	- Data Storage interface
	- Disk Storage Provider (implements Data Storage interface)
	- Streaming of data into runtime memory structure from Data provider interface

This project should define a fast mesh simplification algorithm that can maintain mesh boundary conditions for each cell


What should be the interface for having millions of particles, some static and some dynamic that need to update meshes

Also some bodies (group of particles) may be dynamic, but the particle motion internal to the body is static, so the mesh only transforms, but does not update.







# Build ParticleDynamicsLib Project

This project should be built on top of the existing high performance C based physics 
engine ODE (OpenDynamicsEngine) 

We want to define a physics system for the matter particles here that supports both static and dynamic particles.

* Create the project directory
* Create the git repo for the project
* Download ODE into the Libraries folder
* Create the app code for a basic test of ODE based off the BasicWindowApp project, but add a rotating cube that contains some particles bouncing around and interacting

* Carefully define the generic properties of all particles
* Define how the particles should update

- The particles should have some properties like tempurature/energy level
- We should have a series of rules between contacting particle types
	- Do they bind, repel, etc also based on thier current state (low energy vs high energy)
	- How do they transfer energy to neighbor particles



- The particles themselves should define thier material type
	- What are some initial material types we should use? Ideally base these off known elements so we
	  can have some understanding of interactions that might take place
	  	- Water
	  	- Alcohol
	  	- Iron
	  	- Steel
	  	- Aluminum
	  	- Granite
	  	- Concrete
	  	- Glass
	  	- Quartz
	  	- Oxygen
	  	- Hydrogen
	  	- Mercury



Initial Game:


	The game idea should be asteroid mining, make money, upgrade ship, don't die.
		(How simple can I make this? How quickly can this come to market?)

	3D rotations, 2D gameplay world, raytraced everything, HDR, bloom, etc
