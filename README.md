## Features

- **Real-time particle physics** using ODE physics engine
- **3D rendering** with raylib graphics library
- **Interactive controls**: 
  - Add particles with SPACE key
  - Create particle explosions with E key
  - Reset simulation with R key
  - First-person camera controls with WASD and mouse
- **Collision detection** between particles and ground plane
- **Performance monitoring** with physics timing information

## Dependencies

### Required Libraries

1. **raylib** - Graphics and input handling
   - Automatically built from `../Libraries/raylib/`
   - Cross-platform OpenGL wrapper

2. **Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)** - Physics simulation
   - Downloaded from GitHub (thomasmarsh/ODE)
   - Built with CMake for static linking

3. **ObjectAllocatorLib** - Memory management
   - Copied from `../ObjectAllocatorLib/`
   - Efficient object allocation system

### Build Tools Required

- **CMake** (for building ODE)
- **GCC/MinGW** or **Visual Studio** compiler
- **Make** build system

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

1. Install build tools:
   ```bash
   # On Windows (using chocolatey)
   choco install cmake mingw make
   
   # On Linux/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential
   
   # On macOS
   brew install cmake
   ```

2. Download dependencies:
   ```bash
   make download-ode
   ```

### Compilation

```bash
# Build for current platform
make

# Build for Linux from WSL
make WSL_LINUX=1

# Cross-compile for Windows
make TARGET=windows-native

# Clean build files
make clean
```

## Controls

- **Mouse + WASD**: First-person camera movement
- **SPACE**: Add particle at camera position
- **E**: Create particle explosion at origin
- **R**: Reset simulation
- **ESC**: Toggle mouse capture

## Physics Configuration

The particle system includes:

- **Gravity**: -9.81 m/s² (realistic Earth gravity)
- **Bounce Factor**: 0.8 (particles bounce with 80% energy retention)
- **Friction**: 0.1 (ground friction coefficient)
- **Collision Detection**: Sphere-sphere and sphere-plane collisions
- **Contact Resolution**: Stable contact joints with soft CFM

## Code Structure

### Main Application (`main.cpp`)
- Window management and main loop
- Input handling and camera controls
- Rendering coordination

### Particle System (`particle_system.h/cpp`)
- ODE physics world management
- Particle creation and simulation
- Collision detection and response
- Rendering of particles as colored spheres

### Memory Management
- Uses ObjectAllocatorLib for efficient memory allocation
- Smart pointers for automatic cleanup
- RAII pattern for physics resources

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Native builds with MinGW or MSVC
- **Linux**: Native builds with GCC
- **macOS**: Native builds with Clang
- **WSL**: Cross-compilation to Windows

## Performance

The system tracks physics simulation time and displays:
- Frame rate (FPS)
- Particle count
- Physics step time in milliseconds

Optimized for real-time simulation with:
- Fixed time step limiting (max 1/60 second)
- Efficient collision broad phase
- Minimal memory allocations during simulation

## Example Output

## Extending the System

The modular design allows easy extension:

1. **Add new particle types** by extending the Particle struct
2. **Implement new forces** by modifying the physics step
3. **Add constraints** using ODE joint system
4. **Enhanced rendering** with particle trails or effects
5. **Save/load** simulation states

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure CMake and compiler are in PATH
- Check ODE download completed successfully
- Verify raylib builds for your platform

### Runtime Issues
- Check ODE initialization messages
- Monitor particle count (too many particles slow simulation)
- Verify OpenGL context creation
